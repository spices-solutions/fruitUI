# FruitUI a modular styling framework

when you use bootstarp for just the grid system or use the responsive navbar component ,
if you want to use the grid system you have to load about **15k** lines of css code and if you loaded the full bootstarp bundle or if you use the bootstarp grid preset it contains {padding ,margin, etc...} it's about **6k** lines of code I don't want all this stuff so I create this library with it.

So you can import just one component like just the navbar or import just the grid system
