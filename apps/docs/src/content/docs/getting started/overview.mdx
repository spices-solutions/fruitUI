```tsx
console.log("Introduction.")

console.log("Subtraction.") // [!code focus] // [!code --]

console.log("Addition.") // [!code focus] // [!code ++]

console.log("In focus.") // [!code focus]

console.log("End.")
```

## Why ?

Bootstrap can be a bit of a heavyweight, packing around 15k lines,
and its grid system alone throws in another 6k lines of code – that's a lot of baggage! Plus,
Bootstrap tends to go overboard with styles you might not even need, 
and it's not the most customizable. Now, enter FruitUI – it's modular, so you only grab what you actually want. Just need the grid system or the navbar? No problem, pick and choose with FruitUI!

## usage

### via cdn


<CodeBlock theme="material-theme" lang="html" code={
`<!-- js -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/spices-fruitui"></script>

<!-- css -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/spices-fruitui/style">`} />

### via npm

```bash
npm i spices-fruitui
```


 import sass from node_modules

```scss
@import "node_modules/fruitUI/src/scss/lib/import/basket";

```
a better way

```scss
@use "~/basket" as * with (
  $a-var: true, // pass var for sass runtime err
);

```

 import javascript

```js
import { Navbar } form "spices-fruitui"

```
